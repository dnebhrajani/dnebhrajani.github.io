# About

I'm a self-trained artist with a passion for sketching and portraiture in
charcoal and graphite. From finger-drawings on a freshly-painted
wall, to lettering quotes in a skating rink and painting my shoes, art has been
consistent with me for as long as I can remember. While I've tried several
different styles and mediums, including quilling paper strips, origami, acrylic,
watercolour, ink, and a few others, there's something about being able to generate art
with nothing more than a pencil that has an irresistable hold on me.

My work in charcoal and graphite is centered on impressionalism and realism, with
the occasional semi-abstract acrylic or watercolour.
