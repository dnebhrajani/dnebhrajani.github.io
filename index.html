    <p>I’m a self-trained artist with a passion for sketching and portraiture in charcoal and graphite. From finger-drawings on a freshly-painted wall, to lettering quotes in a skating rink and painting my shoes, art has been consistent with me for as long as I can remember. While I’ve tried several different styles and mediums, including quilling paper strips, origami, acrylic, watercolour, ink, and a few others, there’s something about being able to generate art with nothing more than a pencil that has an irresistible hold on me.</p>
