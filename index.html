    <p>I’m a self-trained artist with a passion for sketching and portraiture in charcoal and graphite. From finger-drawings on a freshly-painted wall, to lettering quotes in a skating rink and painting my shoes, art has been consistent with me for as long as I can remember. While I’ve tried several different styles and mediums, including quilling paper strips, origami, acrylic, watercolour, ink, and a few others, there’s something about being able to generate art with nothing more than a pencil that has an irresistible hold on me.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I studied in California until the first grade. After moving to India, I continued my education at The Orchid School, where I completed grades 1 through 12. I’ve always had a strong passion for science and mathematics, and my academic pursuits consistently revolved around these subjects. I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at IIIT-Hyderabad.</p>
