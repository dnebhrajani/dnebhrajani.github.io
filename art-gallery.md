  This artwork has easily been the hardest I've ever made. It totalled about
  twelve hours of nearly continuous work, spread over less than a day. This was my
  first attempt at drawing somebody over the age of forty - it took a lot longer
  than I expected.
  My reason for choosing this particular reference was mainly the
  expression - I wanted to replicate the way it clearly bore reminiscence.
